When looking at the cleaned and filtered data, the vine members do not show any bias towards the data. The total reviews for pet supplies were 38,010 and only 170 of those votes were vine members. When looking at the amount of vine members only 38.2% were 5-star reviews. The total 5- star reviews are 20,677 and of those only 65 were from vine members. The vast majority of the 5-star reviews were given by the non-vine members. It’s safe to say, there is little to no bias in the dataset, as the vine members don’t heavily impact the star ratings of the pet supply products.
